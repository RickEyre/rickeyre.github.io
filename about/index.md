Richard Eyre
============
Oh hai, I didn't see you there.

I'm Richard Eyre, a Software Developer working in the open-source community --
currently at Seneca College's Centre for Development of Open Technology where I
work primarily on Mozilla projects.

I will be using this blog to post about my thoughts, ideas, experiments, and
adventures in the mostly monotonous, but sometimes exciting world of software
development!
