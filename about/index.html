  <strong>I'm Richard Eyre</strong>, a Software Developer currently working at <a href="http://www.eventmobi.com/">Eventmobi</a>.
  I've previously worked at Seneca College's <a href="http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Centre for Development of Open Technology</a>
  and CPI Canada. I enjoy working in the open-source community and am most involved in Mozilla projects. My main work has been on implementing the
  <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-video-element.html#the-track-element">HTML5 &lt;track&gt;</a>
  and <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webvtt/">WebVTT</a> specifications for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko">Gecko</a>.
  I also dabble in other Mozilla projects from time to time and have contributed to a number of Nodejs projects.
</p>

<p>
  I'm interested in all areas of Software Development having to do with the web. I enjoy working
  on projects that make the web a more open and/or awesome place, make people's lives easier or
  better, or are generally awesome.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy reading, philosophy (particularly eastern philosophy), games, movies,
  and sitcoms.
