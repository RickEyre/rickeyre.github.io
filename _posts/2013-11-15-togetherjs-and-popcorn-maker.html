  Recently I did some work on integrating <a href="https://togetherjs.com/">TogetherJS</a>
  into Popcorn Maker and it has now landed. For anyone who hasn't heard of
  TogetherJS yet it's a tool created by Mozilla that allows easy collaboration
  on websites.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to collaborate on Popcorn Maker now all you need to do is:
  <ul>
    <li>Head over to <a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/">popcorn.webmaker.org</a></li>
    <li>Sign in at the top of the page.</li>
    <li>Hover over your name to get the drop down.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>collaborate!</strong></li>
  </ul>
  Share the link that you get from the TogetherJS side bar and you'll be able to
  to collaborate with your friends in real time, hassle free.
</p>

  Thanks to everyone who helped me out with getting this integrated. Special
  thanks to <a href="http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/">Ian Bicking</a> whose a
  primary developer on TogetherJS and took a lot of time out of his day to help
  me.
</p>

<p>
  That's not it for TogetherJS and Popcorn Maker though! There's still lots of
  improvements and features coming, so look out for more TogetherJS and Popcorn
  Maker in the future!
