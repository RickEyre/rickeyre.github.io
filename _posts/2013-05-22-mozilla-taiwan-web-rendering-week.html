<p>After a ridiculously long flight, 24 hours in total including airport time, we finally arrived in Taiwan, met up with Daniel (IRC:dholbert) and Seth (IRC:seth) and were on our way to the hotel in a cab. The plane ride was pretty good. Uneventful... just super long. </p>

<p>It's now Wednesday and it's been an awesome and eventful week. I've been meeting tons of Mozilla devs and learning a lot. We've also been working hard on landing that initial support for WEBVTT I was talking about in my <a href="/2013/05/16/getting-ready-for-taiwan.html">last blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Sunday I was kind of jet lagged so I took a quick power nap and woke up for dinner which we ate at the Tapei 101 building (formerly the tallest building in the world). Dinner was like 15 courses? Pretty full after that.</p>

<p>After sleeping Sunday night I was pretty much jet lag free... I was kind of surprised as I've heard it's really hard to deal with for some people. My first experience with it was kind of a non-issue. It's probably because I'm used to sleeping late anyways... so really I just corrected my schedule to what's normal for most people.</p>

<p>This week is pretty much a week where all the Web Rendering people can get together and work and talk face to face. There's been a lot of meetings, some of which I've sat in on, that are super interesting and informative. <a href="https://twitter.com/rocallahan">Robert</a> (IRC:roc) gave an excellent talk on the working culture at Mozilla which has really reiterated to me again how awesome the Mozilla working culture really is and how different it is from other companies. The talk touched on openness at Mozilla, code review, software quality, and module ownership vs. Mozilla's managerial structure among many other things.</p>

<p>Aside from working on initial WEBVTT support I've also been getting reacquainted with the specification as it's changed a lot since I last looked at it, going over all the bugs that we currently have for WEBVTT in order to get some kind of an idea of what we need to do next, and engaging in a lot of discussions about what we think the WEBVTT spec needs to improve on or change. This is great as when I get back to Toronto I'll have a better plan of what needs to be done and how we are going to do it.</p>

<p>I'm also learning a ton about different areas Gecko that I didn't know about before just by listening to and talking to others. Overall I'd say I've learnt way more then I could ever hope to do in the same amount of time sitting on IRC chatting with people.</p>

<p>One other thing I'm looking forward to is a talk on the cycle collector that <a href="https://twitter.com/khuey_">Kyle</a> (khuey) is going to be giving tomorrow. The more I try to work with and use cycle collection the more I want to understand it. Hopefully I can walk away from the talk with a better understanding of how it works.</p>

<p>Here are some assorted pictures of the Mozilla Taiwan office. It's pretty brand spanking new. The office space they have us working in was actually just finished before we got here and they had to push the contractors to get it done early. It's right across from the Bloomberg office here in Taipei as well as some other cool places. It's literally 30 seconds from Taipei 101, so it's right in the downtown core of the city.</p>

<p>Stinks that I won't have enough time to check out many other places in Taipei as work is taking up most of my time. Taiwan isn't the place I thought I would visit first when traveling to Asia, or even a place I would visit, but it's definitely on my list of places to come back to.</p>
