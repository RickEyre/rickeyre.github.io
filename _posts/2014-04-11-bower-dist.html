<p>
  A while ago I <a href="http://rickeyre.ca/2013/11/16/vtt-bower.html">blogged</a>
  about the troubles of hosting a pre-built distribution of vtt.js for <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>.
  The issue was that there is a build step we have to do to get a distributable
  file that Bower can use. So we couldn't just point Bower at our repo and be
  done with it as we weren't currently checking in the builds. I decided on hosting these builds in a separate
  <a href="https://github.com/RickEyre/vtt.js-dist">repo</a> instead of checking the
  builds into the main repo. However, this got troublesome after a while <strong>(as you might
  be able to imagine)</strong> since I was building and commiting the Bower updates manually
  instead of making a script like I should have. It might be a good thing that I didn't
  end up automating it with a script since we decided to switch to hosting the builds
  in the same repo as the source code.
</p>

<p>
  The way I ended up solving this was to build a grunt task
  that utilizes a number of other tasks to build and commit the files while bumping our library
  version. This way we're not checking in new dist files with every little change
  to the code. Dist files which won't even be available through Bower
  or node because they're not attached to a particular version. We only need to build
  and check in the dist files when we're ready to make a new release.
</p>

<p>
  I called this grunt task <strong>release</strong> and it utilizes the
  <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat">grunt-contrib-concat</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify">grunt-contrib-uglify</a>,
  and <a href="https://github.com/vojtajina/grunt-bump">grunt-bump</a> modules.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  grunt.registerTask( "build", [ "uglify:dist", "concat:dist" ] );

  grunt.registerTask( "stage-dist", "Stage dist files.", function() {
    exec( "git add dist/*", this.async() );
  });

  grunt.registerTask("release", "Build the distributables and bump the version.", function(arg) {
    grunt.task.run( "build", "stage-dist", "bump:" + arg );
  });
</pre>

<p>
  I've also separated out builds into dev builds and dist builds. This way
  in the normal course of development we don't build dist files which are
  tracked by git and have to worry about not commiting those changes. Which would
  be the case because our test suite needs to build the library in order to
  test it.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  grunt.registerTask( "build", [ "uglify:dist", "concat:dist" ] );
  grunt.registerTask( "dev-build", [ "uglify:dev", "concat:dev" ])
  grunt.registerTask( "default", [ "jshint", "dev-build" ]);
</pre>

<p>
  Then when we're ready to make a new release with a new dist we would just run.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  grunt release:patch // Or major or minor if we want too.
</pre>
