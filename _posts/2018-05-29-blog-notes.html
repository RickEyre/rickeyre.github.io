<ul>
	<li>Cycle collector -- marking things colours, js only black or grey, cc runs then gc then cc then gc, cc primarily for collecting cycles i.e. one things points to one things points to same thing, happens frequenctly in gecko for wrapper caches i.e. where js owns c++ object, c++ objects own eachother, or c++ object owns it's wrapper cache which happens when they want to preserve something, like when a custom property was set on it that they might need to retrieve later, i.e. the js can't just recreate it, cc runs to determine what is black and grey, what is blacks is cascading from root dom node, cc then runs to see if anything it points to is grey, gc runs and can see again and see that it is thing and there fore not black, ref counts decrease to 0, if ref count is 1 then that means there is something outside of cycle, therefore not delete, talk about what needed to implement, taverse, unlink, etc, link to kyle's blog</li>
