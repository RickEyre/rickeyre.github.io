  One of the biggest problems I faced when developing <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/vtt.js">vtt.js</a>
  is that a lot of the layout algorithm depends on being able to know the line
  height of the subtitle text. This boils down to being able to know the line
  height of the div within which the subtitle text sits. A lot of
  the time this is easy to get:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var lineHeight = div.style.lineHeight;
</pre>

<p>
  But, what if you haven't set a line height? Then you would need to get the
  computed value of the line height:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var lineHeight = window.getComputedStyle(null, div).getPropertyValue("lineHeight");
</pre>

<p>
  This works... some of the time. On some browsers if you try to get the computed
  value of the line height and you haven't explicitly set a line height, the computed
  property will return back as the value <strong>normal</strong>. That's helpful...
</p>

<p>
  After much searching I found out that you if you use
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.getClientRects">getClientRects</a>
  on an <strong>inline</strong> element it will return you a
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIDOMClientRect">TextRectangle</a>
  box for each line of text in the inline element. At that point you can either
  assume that each line has the same height and get just use the <strong>height</strong>
  property of the first <strong>TextRectangle</strong> or to get a somewhat more
  accurate number you can take the height of the inline element and divide it by
  the number of TextRectangles you have.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var inlineElement = document.getElementById("myInlineElement"),
      textRectangles = inlineElement.getClientRects(),
      container = inlineElement.getBoundingClientRect(),
      lineHeight = container.height / textRectangles.length;

  alert("The average line height is: " + lineHeight);
</pre>

<p>
  This works really well for the amount of actual code you need to write. I've read
  about more accurate methods, but they take some serious coding. Like walking through
  each character in the text and tracking when overflow happens serious.
</p>

<p>
  Now back to my original question which was how to get the number of lines of
  text in a div <strong>(block level)</strong> element. The way I did this was to wrap my div
  which has my content in another div, and set the inner
  div's display property to <strong>inline</strong>. Then you can calculate the
  line height/number of lines of text of the inner div since it has inline display.
  This way you retain your contents block level layout while being able to figure
  out how many lines of text it is.
</p>

<p>
  This is it all put together:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div id="content" style="display:inline;"&gt;
      This is all my content in here. I wonder how many lines it is?
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var inlineElement = document.getElementById("content"),
      textRectangles = inlineElement.getClientRects(),
      container = inlineElement.getBoundingClientRect(),
      lineHeight = container.height / textRectangles.length;

  alert("The average line height is: " + lineHeight);
</pre>
