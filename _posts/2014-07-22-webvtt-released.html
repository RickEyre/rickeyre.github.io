<p>
  If you haven't seen the release notes WebVTT has finally been
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/31.0/releasenotes/">released in Firefox 31.</a>
  I'm super excited about this as it's the culmination of a lot of my own and countless others'
  work over the last two years. Especially since it has been delayed for releases 29 and 30.
</p>

<p>
  That being said, there are still a few known major bugs with WebVTT in Firefox 31:
  <ul>
    <li>
      TextTrackCue enter, exit, and change events do not work yet. I'm working on getting
      them done now.
    </li>
    <li>
      WebVTT subtitles do not show on audio only elements yet. This will probably be what is tackled
      after the TextTrackCue events.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is no support for any in-band TextTrack WebVTT data yet. If your a video or
      audio codec developer that wants in-band WebVTT to work in Firefox, please help out :-).
    </li>
    <li>
      Oh, and there is no UI on the HTML5 Video element to control subtitles... not the most
      convenient, but it's currently being worked on as well.
    </li>
  </ul>
  I do expect the bugs to start rolling in as well and I'm actually kind of looking
  forward to that as it will help improve WebVTT in Firefox.
