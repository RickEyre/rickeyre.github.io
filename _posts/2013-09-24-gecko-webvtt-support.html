  After three weeks of coding the initial patches and nearly two months of review,
  <strong>Nightly finally plays basic WebVTT captions again!</strong> If you'd like to see a demo you
  can head over to my <a href="http://rickeyre.ca/2013/06/20/webvtt-cycle-collector-demo.html">previous blog post</a>
  where I put together one.
</p>

<h3>Gecko Integration Setup</h3>

<p>
  The set up of our integration of <a href="https://github.com/andreasgal/vtt.js">vtt.js</a>
  into Gecko is fairly simple.
</p>

<p>
  First, we have a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/blob/6462f0bb0d18a650e217aae1dba1f7549236a712/content/media/webvtt/WebVTTParserWrapper.js">WebVTTParserWrapper</a>
  that allows us to wrap a <code>vtt.js</code> parser. It implements the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/blob/6462f0bb0d18a650e217aae1dba1f7549236a712/content/media/webvtt/nsIWebVTTParserWrapper.idl">nsIWebVTTParserWrapper IDL</a>
  which allows us to work with the <code>WebVTTParserWrapper</code> (that was implemented in JS) in C++.
</p>

<p>
  Secondly, we have a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/blob/6462f0bb0d18a650e217aae1dba1f7549236a712/content/media/WebVTTListener.h">WebVTTListener</a>
  class which primarily does two things:
  <ul>
    <li>Listens to the data stream of an <code>HTMLTrackElement</code> and passes the data to the <code>WebVTTParserWrapper</code> to be parsed.
    <li>Receives parsed <code>VTTCues</code> and <code>VTTRegions</code> from <code>vtt.js</code> and adds them to the <code>HTMLTrackElement's Track</code>.
  </ul>
  Since the <code>WebVTTParserWrapper</code> is written in JS we need to define an IDL that the <code>WebVTTListener</code> class
  can implement in order to expose its callbacks to JavaScript.
  The IDL that it implements is the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/blob/6462f0bb0d18a650e217aae1dba1f7549236a712/content/media/webvtt/nsIWebVTTListener.idl">nsIWebVTTListener IDL</a>
  which defines two callbacks that <code>vtt.js</code> needs&mdash;<code>onCue(cue)</code> and
  <code>onRegion(region)</code>.
</p>

<p>
  And that's pretty much it for our current integration of <code>vtt.js</code> into Gecko. Since <code>vtt.js</code>
  implements the parsing section of WebVTT <em>and</em> the DOM tree construction of rendered subtitles, there
  is very little we need to add. To get the DOM tree represenation of a <code>cue</code> we can just call 
  <a href="https://github.com/andreasgal/vtt.js/blob/355f375b6cf04763dcb1843d5683a7c489846425/vtt.js#L433">convertCueToDOMTree()</a>
  on <code>vtt.js</code>, get the <code>div</code> containing the DOM tree, and add it to the video's caption overlay.
</p>

<h3>Moving Forward</h3>

<p>
  The next major step for WebVTT in Gecko is to get what's called the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webvtt/#processing-model">WebVTT processing model</a>
  implemented. This is the section of the spec that positions the <code>cue</code> on the video with respect
  to the <code>cue-settings</code> that have been applied to the <code>cue</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Work on that has already begun, and after some major hurdles having to do with the spec being
  very buggy, <code>vtt.js</code> now applies horizontal or vertical positioning depending on the text orientation of the cue.
  We've yet to integrate that into Gecko though. We still need to finish the part of the processing model that accounts for
  overlap avoidance, i.e. positioning <code>cues</code> so that they don't overlap eachother. After that we can start preparing
  a patch to get that functionality into Gecko.
