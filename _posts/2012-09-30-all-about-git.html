So, in my open source class this semester we have been working heavily with <a title="GIT" href="http://git-scm.com/">GIT</a> and GIT Hub in order to organize and version control our work on the WebVTT implementation in Firefox. Thankfully, I learnt the basics of GIT before I started this class. If I had to be dealing with GIT <em>and</em> all the other stuff that I have been learning , like Makefiles (argh), this class would have been extra hard.

Up until this point I have been proficient with many of GITs basic operations. The GIT operations that you need to know in order to use GIT at all.
<ul>
	<li>git <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull">pull</a></li>
	<li>git <a title="push" href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-push">push</a></li>
	<li>git <a title="clone" href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone">clone</a></li>
	<li>git <a title="init" href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-init">init</a></li>
	<li>git <a title="log" href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-log">log</a></li>
	<li>git <a title="fetch" href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch">fetch</a></li>
	<li>git <a title="branch" href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch">branch</a></li>
	<li>git <a title="merge" href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge">merge</a></li>
</ul>
These are the most basic of GIT commands. And I do pretty basic things with them. Up until this class I have not been able/desired to drive down into the most advanced of GITs capabilities, but now this class is giving me an opportunity to delve a little deeper.

Some things that I learnt that I didn't even know were possible are:
<ul>
	<li>tracking a remote branch which allows you to automatically track updates in the remote branch as well as giving you the ability to do a push if you have r+w permissions</li>
	<li>using git <a title="show" href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-show">show</a> to see the most recent changes between anything - branches, commits, etc</li>
</ul>
The big chunk of what I have learnt in this class regarding GIT is how to properly use GIT in your workflow.
<ul>
	<li>doing small commits instead of big ones so that each change can be rolled back too and tracked easily</li>
	<li>checking out branches in order to test things out such as testing out whether or not your current commit will merge easily with another commit</li>
</ul>
One of my friends in class, <a title="Jordan Raffoul" href="http://jbraffoul.wordpress.com/">Jordan Raffoul</a>, who also works with GIT at his job sent me a link to this really insightful article on what a <a title="successful git branching model" href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">successful git branch model</a> should look like. The article blew me away. It describes a git branching model that accounts for all the work flows in a modern day software development life cycle. From development to production. With capabilities of including hot fixes, bug patches, and feature developments. It's pretty impressive. I know what GIT model I'm recommending next time I start a new project!

The main thing that all this made me realize is that I haven't even scratched the tip of the ice berg with GIT. Even while searching for the links to the GIT web page to post in this blog I saw tons of commands I had never heard of. It makes me wonder how powerful GIT truly is.
