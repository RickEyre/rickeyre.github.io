<p>For a while we've had a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=882915">bug open</a>
to update WebVTT voice tags to show the text of the speaker in the way that the spec wants
us to. At the time I opened the bug I thought that this was something that we would need
to be doing as that was my current understanding. As the bug has progressed though I've
discovered a number of things.</p>

<p>The first was that <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webvtt/#dfn-webvtt-cue-voice-span">WebVTT voice tags</a>
aren't actually supposed to have a default display. I originally
thought that they would as it makes sense to me that they would. Why have voice tags if
they don't show anything? However, after a number of discussions on the public text track
mailing list, where <a href="https://twitter.com/zcorpan">Simon Pieters</a> was kind enough to help me, I found out that the original
reason for this was so that authors could turn voice tags on and off if they want and control how
they display. It would be harder to do this if the author had to struggle with some kind of CSS
that we've already applied to the tag.</p>

<p>For example if the author wanted to apply custom CSS to the voice tag it may be as easy as this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
::cue(v):before { 
    content: attr(voice) ":  "; 
}
</pre>

<p>Which would show: <code>Title Here: Subtitle Here</code></p>

<p>The second thing that I realized stemmed from the issue above. That is that <code>GetCueAsHTML()</code> is not actually 
what the spec would have us use to render the subtitles on the video. This is the way we're currently doing
it in Firefox. Rather, it would like us to generate
CSS boxes, not elements, and use those to render the subtitles on the video instead. The reasoning here is
that CSS boxes are more light weight and you might want that when updating the video every 250 ms, heh. However,
Ralph has since told me that we can just use the same code in <code>GetCueAsHTML()</code> and the processing model as
that's an internal functioning of the spec which we don't need to follow exactly. Possibly in the future we
can switch over to using just straight up CSS boxes, if Gecko allows you to do such a thing, in order to
get some performance boost or something. We shall have to see.</p>

<p><code>GetCueAsHTML()</code> is primarily for showing the cue in other parts of the webpage or for custom subtitles as it's
apart of the exposed API. Whereas, the processing model generates a bunch of CSS boxes with positioning and
styling applied to them specifically for rendering on the video as subtitles.</p>

<p>It's been hard to keep up with the changing spec. When we first sat down to write the browser side <code>GetCueAsHTML()</code>
was the only area for us to hook into; the processing model wasn't there, I'm fairly certain. So for a while
it's been stuck in my mind that this is how it should work. I'm glad that this all came to light as I can
move forward with a better understanding of the spec.</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>
